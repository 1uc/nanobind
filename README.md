# nanobind â€” Seamless operability between C++17 and Python

_nanobind_ is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
versa. It is reminiscent of
_[Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html)_ and
_[pybind11](http://github.com/pybind/pybind11)_ and uses near-identical syntax.

## Why _yet another_ binding library?

I started the _[pybind11](http://github.com/pybind/pybind11)_ project in back
in 2015 to improve the efficiency of C++/Python bindings. Thanks to many
amazing contributions by others, _pybind11_ has become a core dependency of
software across the world including flagship projects like PyTorch and
Tensorflow; every day, the repository is cloned more than 100.000 times. Many
extensions and generalizations were added by users and core developers over the
years to address use cases of this diverse audience. However, all of this
success also came with _costs_: the complexity of the library grew
tremendously, causing overheads on binary size, compilation time, and runtime
performance.

Ironically, the situation feels just like 2015: bindings are once again slow to
compile with existing tools (_Boost.Python_, _pybind11_), and the conditions
(C++17, Python 3.8+) are ripe for drastic simplifications. It seems that
another round of this cycle is needed..

## Performance numbers

TBD

## What are differences between _nanobind_ and _pybind11_?

The main difference is philosophical: _pybind11_ must deal with *all of C++* to
bind complex legacy codebases, while _nanobind_ targets a smaller C++ subset.
**The codebase has to adapt to the binding tool and not the other way around!**
Pull requests with extensions and generalizations were welcomed in _pybind11_,
but they will likely be rejected in this project.

### Removed features

Support for multiple inheritance was a persistent source of complexity in
_pybind11_, and it is one of the main casualties in creating _nanobind_.
Besides this, the following features were removed:

- Binding of classes with overloaded `operator new` / `operator delete`.
- Module-local types or exceptions.
- Eigen and NumPy integration.
- Nested exceptions.
- Pickling.
- `kw_only` / `pos_only` argument annotations.
- MyPy-compatible docstrings.
- PyPy support.
- The `options` class for customizing docstring generation.
- The ability to run several independent Python interpreters in the
  same process, which requires thread-local storage for various
  internal data structures.

Some of these may be reintroduced eventually, but it will need to be done in an
opt-in manner that does not affect binary size and compilation/runtime
performance of the base case.

### Optimizations

Besides removing features, the rewrite was an opportunity to address
long-standing performance issues with _pybind11_:

- C++ objects are co-located with the Python object whenever possible (less
  pointer chasing).
- C++ function binding information is co-located with the Python function
  object (less pointer chasing).
- C++ type binding information is co-located with the Python type object (less
  pointer chasing, fewer hashtable lookups).
- _nanobind_ internally replaces `std::unordered_map` with a more efficient
  hash table ([tsl::robin_map](https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map), which is
  included as a git submodule).
- function calls from/to Python are realized using [PEP 590 vector
  calls](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590), which gives a nice speed
  boost. The main function dispatch loop no longer allocates heap memory.
- _pybind11_ was designed as a header-only library, which is generally a good
  thing because it simplifies the compilation workflow. However, one major
  downside of this is that a large amount of redundant code has to be compiled
  in each binding file (e.g., the function dispatch loop and all of the related
  internal data structures). _nanobind_ compiles a separate shared or static
  support library (`libnanobind`) and links it against the binding code to
  avoid redundant compilation. When using the CMake `nanobind_add_module()`
  function, this all happens transparently.
- `#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>` pulls in a large portion of the STL (about
  2.1 MiB of headers with Clang and libc++). _nanobind_ minimizes STL usage to
  avoid this problem. Type casters even for for basic types like `std::string`
  require an explicit include directive (e.g. `#include
  <nanobind/stl/string.h>`).
- _pybind11_ is dependent on *link time optimization* (LTO) to produce
  reasonably-sized bindings, which makes linking a build time bottleneck. With
  _nanobind_'s split into a precompiled core library and minimal
  metatemplating, LTO is no longer important.

### Dependencies

nanobind depends on very recent versions of everything:

- **C++17**: The `if constexpr` feature was crucial to simplify the internal
  meta-templating of this library.
- **Python 3.8+**: _nanobind_ heavily relies on [vector
  calls](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590) that were introduced in
  version 3.8.
- **CMake 3.17+**: Recent CMake versions include important improvements to
  `FindPython` that this project depends on.

### Syntactic differences

_nanobind_ mostly follows the _pybind11_ syntax, hence the [pybind11
documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable) is the main source of
documentation for this project. A number of API simplifications are
detailed below.

To port existing code with minimal adaptation, you can include
```cpp
#include <nanobind/pybind11.h>
```
which exposes a `pybind11` namespace with the previous naming scheme. (However,
do note the `NB_TRAMPOLINE` discussion below which will require a few changes
if you use the `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE_*()` macros in your code.)

For new projects, note the following differences:

- _nanobind_ types and functions are located in the `nanobind` namespace. The
  `namespace nb = nanobind;` shorthand alias is recommended.

- Macros of the form `PYBIND11_*` (e.g., `PYBIND11_OVERRIDE(..)`) were
  renamed to `NB_*` (e.g., `NB_OVERRIDE(..)`).

- In _pybind11_, implicit type conversions were specified using a follow-up
  function call. In _nanobind_, they are specified within the constructor
  declarations:

  _pybind11_:
  ```cpp
  py::class_<MyType>(m, "MyType")
      .def(py::init<MyOtherType>());

  py::implicitly_convertible<MyOtherType, MyType>();
  ```

  _nanobind_:
  ```cpp
  nb::class_<MyType>(m, "MyType")
      .def(nb::init_implicit<MyOtherType>());
  ```

- Trampoline classes, i.e., polymorphic class implementations that forward
  virtual function calls to Python require an extra `NB_TRAMPOLINE(parent,
  size)` declaration, where `parent` refers to the parent class and `size` is
  at least as big as the number of `NB_OVERRIDE_*()` calls. _nanobind_ caches
  information to enable a more efficient implementation, which requires knowing
  the number of trampoline "slots". Example:

  ```cpp
  struct PyAnimal : Animal {
      NB_TRAMPOLINE(Animal, 1);

      std::string name() const override {
          NB_OVERRIDE(std::string, Animal, name);
      }
  };
  ```

  Trampolines with a too small `size` will be caught and trigger a Python
  `RuntimeError` exception with a descriptive label, e.g.
  `nanobind::detail::get_trampoline('PyAnimal::what()'): the trampoline ran out
  of slots (you will need to increase the value provided to the NB_TRAMPOLINE()
  macro)!`.

- The API of custom type casters has changed _significantly_. In a nutshell,
  the following changes are needed:

  - `load()` was renamed to `from_python()`. The function now takes an extra
    `uint8_t flags` (instead `bool convert`, which is now represented by the
    flag `nanobind::detail::arg_flags::convert`). A `cleanup_list *` pointer
    keeps track of Python temporaries that are created by the conversion, and
    which need to be deallocated after a function call has taken place. `flags`
    and `cleanup` should be passed to any recursive usage of
    `type_caster::from_python()`.

  - `cast()` was renamed to `from_cpp()`. The function takes a return value
    policy (as before) and a `cleanup_list *` pointer.

  Both functions must be marked as `noexcept`. In contrast to _pybind11_,
  errors during type casting are only propagated using status codes. If a
  severe error condition arises that should be reported, use Python warning API
  calls for this, e.g. `PyErr_WarnFormat()`.

  Note that the cleanup list is only available when `from_python()` or
  `from_cpp()` are called as part of function dispatch, while usage by
  `nanobind::cast()` sets `cleanup` to `nullptr`. This case should be handled
  gracefully by refusing the conversion if the cleanup list is absolutely required.

  The [std::pair type
  caster](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/blob/master/include/nanobind/stl/pair.h)
  may be useful as a reference for these changes.

- The following types and functions were renamed:

  | _pybind11_           | _nanobind_     |
  | -------------------- | -------------- |
  | `error_already_set`  | `python_error` |
  | `reinterpret_borrow` | `borrow`       |
  | `reinterpret_steal`  | `steal`        |
