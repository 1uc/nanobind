Creating your first extension
#############################

This section assumes that you have followed the instructions to :ref:`install
<installing>` nanobind and set up a basic :ref:`build system <building>`.

We are now ready to define a first basic extension that wraps a function
to add two numbers. Create a new file ``my_ext.cpp`` with the following
contents (the meaning of this code will be explained shortly):

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <nanobind/nanobind.h>

   int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

   NB_MODULE(my_ext, m) {
       m.def("add", &add);
   }

Afterwards, you should be able to compile and run the extension.

Building using CMake
--------------------

Launch ``cmake`` in the project directory to set up a build system that will
write all output into a separate ``build`` subdirectory.

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S . -B build

.. note::

   If this step fails with an error message saying that Python cannot be
   found, you will need to install a suitable Python 3 development package.

   For example, on Ubuntu you would run:

   .. code-block:: bash

       apt install libpython3-dev

   On Windows, you we recommend downloading and running one of the `installers
   <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ provided by the Python foundation.

.. note::

   If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, the CMake build
   system may not find the specific version you had in mind. This is
   problematic: extension built for one version of Python usually won't run on
   another version. You can provide a hint to the build system to help it find
   a specific version.

   In this case, delete the ``build`` folder (if you already created one) and
   re-run `cmake` while specifying the command line parameter ``-DPython_EXECUTABLE=<path to python executable>``.

   .. code-block:: bash

      rm -Rf build
      cmake -S . -B build -DPython_EXECUTABLE=<path to python executable>

Assuming the ``cmake`` ran without issues, you can now compile the extension using
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake --build build

Finally, navigate into the ``build`` directory and launch an interactive Python
session:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build
   python3

You should be able to import the extension and call the newly defined function ``my_ext.add()``.

.. code-block:: pycon

   Python 3.11.1 (main, Dec 23 2022, 09:28:24) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)] on darwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import my_ext
   >>> my_ext.add(1, 2)

Binding functions
-----------------

Let's step through the example binding code to understand what each line does.
The directive on the first line includes the core parts of nanobind:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <nanobind/nanobind.h>

nanobind also provides many optional add-on components that are aren't
included by default. They are discussed throughout this documentation along
with pointers to the header files that must be included when using them.

Next is the function to be exposed in Python, followed by the
mysterious-looking :c:macro:`NB_MODULE` macro.

.. code-block:: cpp

   int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

   NB_MODULE(my_ext, m) {
       m.def("add", &add);
   }

:c:macro:`NB_MODULE(my_ext, m) <NB_MODULE>` declares the extension with the
name ``my_ext``. This name **must** match the extension name provided to the
``nanobind_add_module()`` function in the CMake build system---otherwise,
importing the extension will fail with an obscure error about a missing
symbol. The second argument (``m``) names a variable of
type :cpp:class:`nanobind::module_` that represents the created module.

The part within curly braces (``{``, ``}``) consists of a sequence of
statements that initialize the desired function and class bindings. It is best
thought of as the ``main()`` function that will run when a user imports the
extension into a running Python session.

In this case, there is only one binding declaration that wraps the ``add``
referenced using the ampersand (``&``) operator. nanobind determines the
function's type signature and generates the necessary binding code. All of
this happens automatically at compile time.

.. note::

    Notice how little code was needed to expose our function to Python: all
    details regarding the functionâ€™s parameters and return value were
    automatically inferred using template metaprogramming. This overall
    approach and the used syntax go back to `Boost.Python
    <https://github.com/boostorg/python>`_, though the implementation in
    nanobind is very different.

.. _keyword_and_default_args:

Keyword and default arguments
-----------------------------

There are limits to what nanobind can determine at compile time. For example,
the argument names were lost and calling ``add()`` in Python using keyword
arguments fails:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> my_ext.add(a=1, b=2)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: add(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported:
       1. add(arg0: int, arg1: int, /) -> int

   Invoked with types: kwargs = { a: int, b: int }

Let's improve the bindings to fix this. We will also add a docstring and a
default ``b`` argument so that ``add()`` increments when only one value is
provided. The modified binding code looks as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <nanobind/nanobind.h>

   namespace nb = nanobind;
   using namespace nb::literals;

   int add(int a, int b = 1) { return a + b; }

   NB_MODULE(my_ext, m) {
       m.def("add", &add, "a"_a, "b"_a = 1,
             "This function adds two numbers and increments if only one is provided").
   }

Let's go through all of the changed lines. The first sets up a short
namespace alias named ``nb``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   namespace nb = nanobind;

This is convenient because binding code usually ends up referencing many
classes and functions from this namespace. The subsequent ``using``
declaration is optional and enables a convenient syntax for annotating
function arguments:

.. code-block:: cpp

   using namespace nb::literals;

Without it, you would have to change every occurrence of the pattern ``"..."_a``
to the more verbose ``nb::arg("...")``.

The function binding declaration includes several changes. It common to pile
on a few attributes and modifiers in :cpp:func:`.def(...) <module_::def()>`
binding declarations, which can be specified in any order.

.. code-block:: cpp

   m.def("add", &add, "a"_a, "b"_a = 1,
         "This function adds two numbers and increments if only one is provided").

The string at the end is a `docstring <https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/>`_
that will later show up in generated documentation. The argument annotations
(``"a"_a, "b"_a``) associate parameters with names for keyword-based
argument passing.

Besides argument names, nanobind also cannot infer *default arguments*---you
*must repeat them* in the binding declaration. In the above snippet, the
``"b"_a = 1`` annotation informs nanobind about the value of the default
argument.

Exporting values
----------------

To export a value, use the :cpp:func:`attr() <nanobind::detail::api::attr>`
function to register it in the module as shown below. Bound classes and
built-in types are automatically converted when they are assigned in this
way.

.. code-block:: cpp

    m.attr("the_answer") = 42;

Docstrings
----------

Let's add one more bit of flourish by assigning a docstring to the extension
module itself. Add the following line anywhere in the body of the ``NB_MODULE()
{...}`` declaration:

.. code-block:: cpp

    m.doc() = "A simple example python extension";

After recompiling the extension, you should be able to view the associated
documentation using the ``help()`` builtin or the ``?`` operator in
IPython.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import my_ext
   >>> help(my_ext)

   Help on module my_ext:

   NAME
       my_ext - A simple example python extension

   DATA
       add = <nanobind.nb_func object>
           add(a: int, b: int = 1) -> int

           This function adds two numbers and increments if only one is provided

       the_answer = 42

   FILE
       /Users/wjakob/my_ext/my_ext.cpython-311-darwin.so

The automatically generated documentation covers functions, classes,
parameter and return value type information, argument names, and default
arguments.

Lambda functions
----------------

All nanobind features that expect functions also work for *stateless* and
*stateful* lambda functions (i.e., lambdas with with captured variable
state). For example, the following binding declaration is valid:

.. code-block:: cpp

   int amount = 3;

   m.def("scale",
         [=amount](int a) { return a * amount; });
